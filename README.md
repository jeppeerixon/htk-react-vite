# HTKappen 2.0
React port of my very basic traning/fitness app https://github.com/jeppeerixon/htkappen for my olympic weightlifting club.

Plan is to make it a fullstack app using AWS Amplify.



## To run the app locally

Clone the repo on your own computer then enter the following in the terminal:

- npm i
- npm run dev

## Tech stack:
React - TypeScript - Vite - Sass
